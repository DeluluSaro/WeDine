2. Building Your Own E-Wallet System
You can build a custom e-wallet system in your app:
Maintain a user balance in your database.
Allow users to add money to their wallet using Razorpay (via a “top-up” payment).
Deduct from their wallet balance when they make a purchase.
You are responsible for all compliance, refunds, and wallet management.
